	abstract = {In this work, a phase field grain growth model coupled with a spectral stress calculation method is used to investigate the effect of applied elastic deformation on grain growth in 2D copper polycrystals with isotropic grain boundary properties. The applied deformation accelerates the grain growth compared to a relaxed polycrystal, though the effect of the deformation decreases rapidly with time. The softest grain orientations with respect to the applied deformation grow at the expense of other orientations, though they have higher elastic energy density. Due to a rapid decrease in the elastic energy stored in the system, the {GB} energy eventually dominates the growth leading to a linear change in the average grain area with time. Increasing the magnitude of the applied deformation accelerates the growth, while increasing the temperature accelerates the growth but decreases the effect of the applied deformation.},

	abstract = {The characteristics of 3-D grain growth are investigated by a topological analysis of phase-Ô¨Åeld simulation results compared with theoretical mean-Ô¨Åeld theories. We found that the size distribution of the grains starting from an arbitrary narrow distribution crosses the self-similar Hillert distribution, and ends in a distribution with relatively longer tails of large grains in which the central peak shifted towards smaller grain size. The distribution of topological classes, as characterized by the number of facets per grain, is found to be timeinvariant for the process as a whole. The obtained shape function is in good agreement with the analytical distribution function derived based on the average N-hedron model [Rios {PR}, Glicksman {ME}. Act Mater 2008;56:1165]. The volumetric growth rate per topological class also correlates well with the analytical approach obtained by Mullins [Mullins {WW}. Acta Mater 1956;3:900]. The relationship between grain size and its shape, however, deviates from theoretical predictions.},

	abstract = {Abnormal grain growth ({AGG}) can take place when the grain boundaries of a given grain have the growth advantage exclusively over those of the other grains. The growth advantage can be provided either by high mobility or by low energy of the grain boundaries. Monte Carlo simulation is done to determine which of the two factors is more important in inducing {AGG}. The results of the simulation indicate that the growth advantage by the low energy induces {AGG} under a more realistic condition if the grain boundary energy is low enough to allow the {AGG} grain to grow by solid-state wetting. Grain growth by wetting will take place at the triple junction when the sum of the two grain boundary energies is smaller than the other grain boundary energy. Island grains inside the {AGG} grain are formed both by anisotropic mobility and energy of grain boundaries. High frequency of island grains, however, comparable to that observed in the initial stage of {AGG} in an Fe-3\%Si alloy, is induced under a condition where growth by wetting is favored while the grain boundary migration is suppressed.},

	abstract = {Recent experiments (Le Bouil et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2014, 112, 246001) have analyzed the statistics of local deformation in a granular solid undergoing plastic deformation. Experiments report strongly anisotropic correlation between events, with a characteristic angle that was interpreted using elasticity theory and the concept of Eshelby transformations with dilation; interestingly, the shear bands that characterize macroscopic failure occur at an angle that is different from the one observed in microscopic correlations. Here, we interpret this behavior using a mesoscale elastoplastic model of solid flow that incorporates a local Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion. This differs from the interpretation of Le Bouil et al., which is based on purely elastic considerations ignoring the potential role of local friction on deformation patterns. We show that the angle observed in the microscopic correlations can be understood by combining the elastic interactions associated with Eshelby transformation with the local failure criterion. At large strains, we also induce permanent shear bands at an angle that is different from the one observed in the correlation pattern. We interpret this angle as the one that leads to the maximal instability of slip lines.},

	abstract = {The Kobayashi‚ÄìWarren‚ÄìCarter ({KWC}) phase-field model was originally conceived for two-dimensional systems to model grain boundary migration and grain rotation, which play a crucial role in nanocrystalline materials, and in phenomena such as superplasticity and recrystallization. Existing generalizations of the {KWC} model to three-dimensions construct the grain boundary energy as a function of misorientation angle between the grains, described as a scalar, and the inclination of the grain boundary. It is well-known that grain boundary energy is described on a five-dimensional space, where three dimensions describe misorientations and two describe inclinations. In this work, we generalize the {KWC} model by constructing a frame-invariant energy density that is sensitive to all the five-dimensions of misorientations and inclinations. In addition, we derive representations for energy density that result in different forms of anisotropies in inclination and misorientation. The developed framework enables us to introduce the effect of material symmetry on the inclination-dependence. We demonstrate the richness of the model using various three-dimensional numerical examples that simulate anisotropic grain coarsening and grain rotation.},
